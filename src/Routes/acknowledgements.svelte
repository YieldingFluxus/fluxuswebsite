          <br />
          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and

          owner that is granting the License.<br />
          <br />
          "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other
          entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with
          that entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the
          power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such

          <br />
          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form,
          made available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that

          below).<br />
          <br />
          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
          that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
          revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent,
          as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
          Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
          merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
          Works thereof.<br />
          <br />
          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
          version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
          Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
          inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
          Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes
          of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or

          control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on
          behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the
          Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."<br
          /><br />
          <br />
          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
          behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently

          <br />
          2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
          License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
          non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
          reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
          sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source
          or Object form.<br />
          <br />
          3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
          License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
          non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in
          this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell,
          import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only
          to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
          infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute
          patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
          in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
          the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
          patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.<br /><br />
          <br />
          4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work
          or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications,
          and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:<br
          />
          <br />
          You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
          of this License; and<br />
          <br />
          You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
          You changed the files; and<br />
          <br />
          You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute,
          all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source
          form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
          of the Derivative Works; and<br />
          <br />
          If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
          then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy
          of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
          those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works,
          in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation,
          if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
          by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
          appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes
          only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices
          within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum
          to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution
          notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may add Your
          own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional
          or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution
          of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided
          Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
          with the conditions stated in this License.<br /><br />
          <br />
          5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You
          to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License,
          without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above,
          nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
          agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.<br
          />
          <br />
          6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except
          as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of
          the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.<br />
          <br />
          7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed
          to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides
          its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
          OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
          any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
          or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
          the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.<br
          />
          <br />
          8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether
          in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
          by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed
          to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including
          any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of
          any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or
          inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss
          of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
          all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been
          advised of the possibility of such damages.<br />
          <br />
          9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a
          fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
          obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting
          such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
          responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
          agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any
          liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by
          reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.<br
